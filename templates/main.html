    <h1>The Overview</h1>
    <article class="flex-container" style="padding: 20px 70px;">
        <p id="overview">
            The CatDog Pet Pharmacy, working closely with a network of 10 local Veterinarians, provides services to an
            average of 500 pet clients annually.
            These services are exclusively for owned pets; the pharmacy and its associated veterinarians do not cater to
            stray animals. Additionally,
            it is assumed that each pet client is assigned to only one veterinarian to ensure consistency and
            personalized care. The pharmacy offers a range
            of Medications, dispensing approximately 1,000 Prescriptions per year, generating an average annual revenue
            of $50,000. CatDog Pet Pharmacy
            hopes to deploy a website that will record prescriptions dispensed per year, number of prescriptions that
            are picked up, annual total revenue,
            and most frequently prescribed medications. The website will also document the number of Pets each
            veterinary clinic has with the pharmacy.
            Furthermore, the system lists the contact information for Veterinarians and Owners, medication information,
            and pet demographics. Since all clients
            are based in the United States, there is no need to consider international dialing codes for contact
            numbers. If the veterinarians are located
            abroad, they can be reached via their provided email addresses. With this website, CatDog Pet Pharmacy will
            be able to better understand and meet
            the needs of their clients. Note there are some limitations to our website. In a real world scenario, our
            database would have additional transaction
            type tables but for simplicity, cost is given for each set quantity of medication and a total
            prescription_cost is calculated for the cost of all
            medications in a prescription. Furthermore, our practice strives to uphold privacy practices, such that
            medication and prescription records are
            deleted completely for clients that we no longer serve.
