      <p id="overview">
        The <em><b>CatDog Pet Pharmacy</b></em>, working closely with a network of 10 local Veterinarians, provides
        services to
        an
        average of 500 pet clients annually.
        These services are exclusively for owned pets; the pharmacy and its associated veterinarians do not cater to
        stray animals. Additionally,
        it is assumed that each pet client is assigned to only one veterinarian to ensure consistency and
        personalized care. The pharmacy offers a range
        of <em>Medications</em>, dispensing approximately 1,000 <em>Prescriptions</em> per year, generating an average
        annual
        revenue
        of $50,000. CatDog Pet Pharmacy
        hopes to deploy a website that will record prescriptions dispensed per year, number of prescriptions that
        are picked up, annual total revenue,
        and most frequently prescribed medications. The website will also document the number of Pets each
        veterinary clinic has with the pharmacy.
        Furthermore, the system lists the contact information for <em>Veterinarians</em> and <em>Owners</em>, medication
        information,
        and pet demographics. Since all clients
        are based in the United States, there is no need to consider international dialing codes for contact
        numbers. If the veterinarians are located
        abroad, they can be reached via their provided email addresses. With this website, CatDog Pet Pharmacy will
        be able to better understand and meet
        the needs of their clients. Note there are some limitations to our website. In a real world scenario, our
        database would have additional transaction
        type tables but for simplicity, cost is given for each set quantity of medication and a total
        prescription_cost is calculated for the cost of all
        medications in a prescription. Furthermore, our practice strives to uphold privacy practices, such that
        medication and prescription records are
        deleted completely for clients that we no longer serve.
