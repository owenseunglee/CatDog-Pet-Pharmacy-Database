CatDog-Pet-Pharmarcy is a challeneging real world web application in Python Flask using a MySQL database backend.

#**Overview**
CatDog-Pet-Pharmacy specializes in offering pharmaceutical services exclusively to owned pets, ensuring that each pet receives personalized care by being asigned to a single veterinarian.

#**Goals of the Website**
The primary goal of deploying this website is to create a centralized platform where CatDog Pet Pharmacy can efficiently track and manage:

The total number of prescriptions dispensed per year.
The count of prescriptions that are picked up by pet owners.
Annual revenue generated.
The most frequently prescribed medications.
The number of pets each associated veterinary clinic serves.
Moreover, the website serves as a repository for important information, including:

Contact details for veterinarians and pet owners.
Detailed medication information.
Demographic data concerning the pets under care.

#**Limitations**
While our website aims to be comprehensive, it's designed with simplicity in mind. Therefore, instead of incorporating complex transaction-type tables, medication costs are presented for set quantities, and a total prescription cost is calculated for all the medications within a prescription. Additionally, in alignment with our commitment to privacy and confidentiality, medication and prescription records for clients no longer served are completely removed from our system.
